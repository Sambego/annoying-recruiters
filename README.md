# Annoying recruiters
A gmail filter to send recruiter mails directly to the trash bin 

## Usage
- Go to the gmail web-client
- Open the settings page
- Go to the filters and blocked adresses tab
- Click on the import filters button and import this XML
- Select the filter and create it

## Contributing
Feel free to add more email adresses to the list, but please only add those of recruiters that keep on sending you unwanted mails.

## For recruiters
I'm a nice guy, so if for some reason, you want your email adress removed from this list, please open a pull-request.
